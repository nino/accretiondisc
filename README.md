# Code for the bachelor's thesis *Numerical Simulations of One-Dimensional Self-Gravitating Accretion disc Models*


The module for performing numerical calculations can be found in `src/Disk.jl`. Examples for how to set up and launch a simulation are shown in `src/runall.jl`

The `sims` folder contains the simulation data.
